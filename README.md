Help develop MastoDeck by sharing feedback, bugs and your own ideas. We are super open to feedback and any proposals.

Please go to [the Issues tab](https://github.com/barredo/mastodeck/issues) to send us anything you want, or visit the [public list](https://github.com/users/barredo/projects/1). I am slowly adding all the feedback gathered the last few days by email or Mastodon. 

If you want to make it private or easier for you, you can also send feedback to alex@barredo.es or https://mastodon.social/@MastoDeck

MastoDeck ~~is~~ will be the most advanced Mastodon client for the most demanding users. The focus is to create a real-time, customizable Mastodon experience the way you like it.

MastoDeck is in open beta for the moment. Please bear in mind it still can be buggy and some things may not work. Contact me at https://mastodon.social/@MastoDeck or alex@barredo.es
